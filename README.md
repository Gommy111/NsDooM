# NsDooM

NsDooM is a simple game inspired by Doom and Wolfenstein 3D, mainly having a 2.5D world.  
The game isn't complete and could be extended a lot, however it is a functioning game with score, enemies, death and a weapon.  
The "resources" directory should be kept in the same location as the .jar or src directory for the game to run properly.

right arrow = look right  
up arrow = look up
